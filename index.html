            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
               My full name is Virginia Regina Ferreira da Costa Rabello, I'm married and mother of two beautiful boys. I was born in South-east of Brazil 
               in 1983, back there it was very hard to have a degree and the unemployment rate was very high, 
               after some temporary jobs I was 19 when I decided to open my own business, it was a successful
               Hair Stylist Salon where I worked for 9 years learning, teaching and growing as a person. In 2014
               my family and I had to move to another state, it was a great career oportunity
               for my husband and, since I had to close my business, I decided that it was time to change my path.
               I've always been a passionate about technology, games, computers, etc... but I've never had
               an opportunity to study before. In 2016 I could finally register myself in the University where I started
               my Computers Engineering course, where I studied for 3 years learning computers architecture and 
               coding in low level languages, which makes easier for me learn other languages. In 2019 I was working
               as an Undergraduate Research Fellow in a microelectronics project for the University, where I used to 
               generate logical synthesis for hardware projects and analyze the reports. By the end of 2019, another great 
               opportunity for my husband came out and another big move was necessary, this time we moved to United States
               and since then, my new challenge is to get back in the game and start a new career. I recenttly
               dicovered a new passion for Web Development and I'm investing a lot of my time improving my skills.
